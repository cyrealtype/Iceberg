Iceberg is a slim condensed decorative webfont
by Victor Kharyk suitable for medium to large sizes.

It is monolinear and mostly monospaced, has long ascenders
and descenders, and a modular construction that builds a rhythm. 
These features improve overall readability.

Its monolinear strokes and 45 degree cuts
remind letters made from folded tape.

Iceberg is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.
